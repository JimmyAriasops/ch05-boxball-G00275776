/**
 * Class BoxBall - a graphical ball that moves similar to the ball in PONG.
 * It bounces around the confines of a box as defined by the Box class.
 * Details of movement are determined by the ball itself. It will move to
 * the right when xspeed is positive and to the left when xspeed is negative.
 * Due to the way computer graphics are drawn using awt, the ball moves
 * DOWN when yspeed is positive and UP when yspeed is negative.
 * 
 * It is the ball's responsibility to determine if it has hit a wall and 
 * to reverse direction
 *
 * This movement can be initiated by repeated calls to the "move" method.
